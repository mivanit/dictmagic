# dictmagic
`dictmagic` is a python package that makes it easier to do certain weird things with dictionaries.  
At the moment, it lets you convert back and forth to "flattened" dictionaries that use path syntax instead of nested dictionaries, and simplifies the process of accessing python dictionary elements as attributes. This package is mostly written to loading, saving, using, and coverting between various configuration methods easier.

## installing
```
pip install dictmagic
```
